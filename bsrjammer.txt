Team BSR JammEr. used HTML, JS, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap to create this modified UI web page of DAVIET.
we havent included more bloatware because it might not increase the goodwillness of the web page.

On the navigation bar we are added six functions home,achedmics,department,about-us,blog,and location of the DAVIET collage.
We are adding some cool animation effect/hover effect which makes page attractive and fancy.
We also added Some video element in it, we are added very useful functions in it which are totally related to our collage.
We took some data from DAVIET official site, infact we added direct link of official web page of DAVIET for admissions.
At the end we are try to give simple and user friendly look to our page.
